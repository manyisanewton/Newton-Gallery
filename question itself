/*Project Name: To-Do List App
Description: Build a simple to-do list application where users can:

Add new tasks.
Mark tasks as completed.
Delete tasks.
Features:

A text input to type in tasks.
A button to add tasks.
A list to display tasks.
Tasks should have a checkbox to mark them as completed.
A delete button for each task to remove it from the list.
Basic Requirements:
HTML: Structure for the input, button, and list.
CSS: Styling for the to-do list (e.g., completed tasks have a strikethrough).
JavaScript: Handle user actions like adding, marking as complete, and deleting tasks.
Bonus Challenges:
Save tasks in localStorage so they persist after the page reloads.
Add a counter to show how many tasks are remaining.
Filter tasks (e.g., show all, completed, or active tasks).
How to Run It
Create three files: index.html, styles.css, and script.js.
Copy and paste the respective code into each file.
Open the index.html file in your browser.
What to Submit
Ensure the app runs without errors.
You can customize the design or add extra features like localStorage or task filters if you have time.*/
